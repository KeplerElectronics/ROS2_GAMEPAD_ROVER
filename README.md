Over Winter Break 2023 I wanted to learn how to use ROS2, so I embarked on a simple project to just get a small rover controlled with a gamepad. This is a straight port of the working directory so people can see where and how the files are organized. 

The actual code for the motor drivers is in the py_pubsub folder (should be listener), it was built on top of examples in the documentation.

Uses Joy package for gamepad reading.

More information can be seen in the youtube and webpages for the project (not online yet)
